						In 2018, the museum had to issue a public apology after a group of American tourists were caught
						attempting to cook a meal using a portable stove in the museum's courtyard. The tourists, who
						were reportedly unaware that cooking was not allowed on the premises, had been attempting to
						make tea when they were caught by security.
